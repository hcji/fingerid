FingerID 1.4
============

:warning: This is **not** the code repo for [CSI:fingerID](http://www.csi-fingerid.org) [Dührkop et al].
To use [CSI:fingerID](http://www.csi-fingerid.org), please visit this [page](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/). CSI:fingerID extends the method of this repo in many ways, including but not limited to: 
more kernels for MS/MS spectra, a different set of molecular fingerprints and a different scoring function, etc. 
This repo is not actively maintained, however, if you spot a bug or have questions, please
open an issue.

This is FingerID 1.4 release. This version will only focus on the fingerprints
prediction, without fingerprints generation and compound database retrieval.
This repo includes the code for the paper:

Shen, H., Dührkop, K., Böcker, S. and Rousu, J., 2014. 
Metabolite identification through multiple kernel learning on fragmentation trees. 
Bioinformatics, 30(12),  pp.i157-i164.

This package utilize fragmentation tree, another view of MS/MS spectra, to 
improve fingerprints prediction.

The previous versions are hosted on sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fingerid/

Please note that the package had NOT been tested on windows. Running the package on linux
is suggested.


Changes
=======

- Fingerprints generation and compound database retrieval are delegated to user.
- Cleaning of the MS/MS spectra is delegated to user.
- Merge of the MS/MS spectra is delegated to user.
- Fragmentation tree information is added in the input by kernel and multiple
kernel learning.

Instructions
============

To use the package, three steps (parse, kernel, predict) are needed sequentially.
Two examples are also provided in shen_ISMB2014.py and train_test.py.

Parse
-----

Parse MS/MS spectra to the internal representation.

- For the MS/MS data in the format as example dataset provided in the package, one can use the following: 

  ```python
  from fingerid.preprocess.msparser import MSParser
  # ms_folder is the folder for all the spectra.
  msparser = MSParser()
  ms_list = msparser.parse_dir(ms_folder) 
  ```

- For the MS/MS data downloaded from MassBank:

  ```python  
  from fingerid.preprocess.massbankparser import MassBankParser
  mbparser = MassBankParser()
  # ms_folder is the folder for all the spectra.
  ms_list = mbparser.parse_dir(ms_folder)
  ```

- For the MS/MS data downloaded from Metlin (.msx format):

  ```python
  from fingerid.preprocess.metlinparser import MetlinParser
  mlparser = MetlinParser()
  # ms_folder is the folder for all the spectra.
  ms_list = mlparser.parse_dir(ms_folder)
  ```

- For the fragmentation tree in .dot format (fgtree_folder is the folder name for fragmentation tree data):

  ```python
  from fingerid.preprocess.fgtreeparser import FragTreeParser
  fgtreeparser = FragTreeParser()
  trees = fgtreeparser.parse_dir(fgtree_folder)
  ```

Kernel
------

Two types of kernel functions are provided. For the MS/MS data, "PPK" kernel is used:
  
  ```python
  from fingerid.preprocess.msparser import MSParser
  from fingerid.kernel.twodgaussiankernel import TwoDGaussianKernel
  train_ms_list = msparser.parse_dir(train_ms_folder)
   
  # Compute the PPK kernel with m/z variance sm and intensity variance si.
  # In practice, tune the sm and si by cross validation is important.
  kernel = TwoDGaussianKernel(sm, si)
  train_km = kernel.compute_train_kernel(train_ms_list)

  # When have test data, to compute test kernel
  test_ms_list = msparser.parse_dir(test_ms_folder)
  test_km = kernel.compute_test_kernel(test_ms_list,train_ms_list)
  ```

For fragmentation tree:

- parse fragmentation tree

  ```python
  from fingerid.preprocess.fgtreeparser import FragTreeParser
  fgtreeparser = FragTreeParser()
  train_trees = fgtreeparser.parse_dir(train_fgtree_folder)
  ```

- Compute training kernel

  ```python
  kernel = FragTreeKernel()
  # Kernel can be "NB","NI","LB","LC","LI","RLB","RLI","CPC","CP2","CPK","CSC"
  train_tree_km = kernel.compute_train_kernel(train_trees, "NB")
  ```  

- When have test data for fragmentation trees

  ```python
  test_trees = fgtreeparser.parse_dir(test_fgtree_folder)  
  n_train = len(train_trees)
  n_test = len(test_trees)

  kernel = FragTreeKernel()
  # Kernel can be "NB","NI","LB","LC","LI","RLB","RLI","CPC","CP2","CPK","CSC"
  train_tree_km = kernel.compute_train_kernel(train_trees, "NB")
  test_tree_km = kernel.compute_test_kernel(test_trees, train_trees, "NB")
  ```

To combine the kernel using MKL (UNIMKL, ALIGN, ALIGNF):

  ```python
  # km_list is a list of kernel matrices (numpy 2d array).
  # output is fingerprint matrix (numpy 2d array).
  # The MKL algorithms can be 'UNIMKL', 'ALIGN' and 'ALIGNF'.
  # ckm is combined kernel and kw is the weights for the kernels.
  # The weights can be used to combine the test kernel.
  from fingerid.kernel.mkl import mkl
  ckm, kw = mkl(km_list, output, 'ALIGN')
  ```

Predict
-------

To perform cross validation on training data:

  ```python
  from fingerid.model.internalCV_mp import internalCV
  # kernel is the kernel matrix (numpy 2d array)
  # labels is fingerprint matrix (numpy 2d array).
  # n_folds is the number of folds used in the cross validation
  # select_c is a boolean variable specify whether to do C selection in SVM.
  n_folds = 5
  cvpreds = internalCV(kernel, labels, n_folds, select_c=False)

  ```
 
To perform cross validation on training data with multiple processes. This is
useful when you have many fingerprints (output) to train:

  ```python
  from fingerid.model.internalCV_mp import internalCV_mp
  # n_p is the number of processes to be used
  cvpreds = internalCV_mp(kernel, labels, n_folds, select_c=False, n_p=8)
  ```

To train the model on all the data instead of doing cross validation:

  ```python
  from fingerid.model.trainSVM import trainModels
  model_dir = "MODELS" # model_dir is the folder to store the trained models
  models = trainModels(kernel, labels, model_dir, select_c=False, n_p)
  ```

To predict on the test data using trained models:

  ```python
  from fingerid.model.trainSVM import trainModels
  from fingerid.model.predSVM import predModels
  model_dir = "MODELS" # model_dir is the folder to put the trained models
  trainModels(train_kernel, labels, model_dir, select_c=False, n_p)
  preds = predModels(test_kernel, n_fp, model_dir) # n_fp is the number of fingerprints
  ```

Tools
-----

It's may be necessary to check whether the spectra and the fragmentation trees are in the same order as wanted. To output the order of the spectra files and fragmentation trees files which have been parsed:

  ```python
  from fingerid.preprocess.util import writeIDs  
  writeIDs("spectras.txt",train_ms)
  writeIDs("fgtrees.txt", train_trees)
  ```
